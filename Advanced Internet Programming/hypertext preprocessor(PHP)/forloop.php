<?php
# The for loop - Loops through a block of code a specified number of times.
//  Using PHP, write a for loop that that prints numbers 2 to 10 

for ($x=2;$x <= 10; $x++){
    echo"$x <br>";
}

// $x = 0; - Initialize the loop counter ($x), and set the start value to 0
// $x <= 10; - Continue the loop as long as $x is less than or equal to 10
// $x++ - Increase the loop counter value by 1 for each iteration
