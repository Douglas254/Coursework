## Advantages and disadvantages of client-side scripts

Developers might consider using client-side scripts for many reasons, and they might have some legitimate reasons not to use them.

### Advantages

Client-side scripts offer numerous advantages, including:

- Allow for more interactivity by immediately responding to users’ actions.
- Execute quickly because they do not require a trip to the server.
- May improve the usability of Web sites for users whose browsers support scripts.
- Can give developers more control over the look and behaviour of their Web widgets.
- Can be substituted with alternatives (for example, HTML) if users’ browsers do not support scripts
- Are reusable and obtainable from many free resources.

### Disadvantages

Client-side scripts also create additional worries which include:

- Not all browsers support scripts, therefore, users might experience errors if no alternatives have been provided.
- Different browsers and browser versions support scripts differently, thus more quality assurance testing is required.
- More development time and effort might be required (if the scripts are not already available through other resources).
- Developers have more control over the look and behaviour of their Web widgets; however, usability problems can arise if a Web widget looks like a standard control but behaves differently or vice-versa.

## Advantages and disadvantages of server-side scripts

### Advantages

- User can create one template for the entire website
- The site can use a content management system which makes editing simpler.
- Generally quicker to load than client-side scripting
- User is able to include external files to save coding.
- Scripts are hidden from view so it is more secure. Users only see the HTML output.
- User does not need to download plugins like Java or Flash.

### Disadvantages

- Many scripts and content management systems tools require databases in order to store dynamic data.
- It requires the scripting software to be installed on the server.
- The nature of dynamic scripts creates new security concerns, in some cases making it easier for hackers to gain access to servers exploiting code flaws.
