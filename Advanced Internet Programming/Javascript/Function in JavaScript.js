// A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
// A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
// Why Functions?
// You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

// You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

function multiplication(p1, p2){
    console.log(p1*p2)
}
multiplication(7,2) // Calling function
